## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my website.

The easiest way to view this project is by using this link: https://srdjan-blogr.netlify.app/

---> Netlify is web service that offers hosting for free (as long as you keep .netlify.app in the adress bar) and other things such as backend services for web apps and static websites.

---> You can also clone these files and open it on your local machine by following these steps:

     1) If you are using VS Code (which I recommend) you should install Live Server extension.
     2) Then, you should install node_modules by using following command in your terminal: npm install
     3) To open the website, you can right click in index.html file and choose "Open with Live Server" or you can click Go Live in the bottom right corner in VS Code

This project was mainly made with html and tailwindcss, but there is also small amount of custom written css and a little bit of JavaScript code (DOM Manipulation).
